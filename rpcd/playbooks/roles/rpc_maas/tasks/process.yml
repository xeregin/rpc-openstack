# NOTE:
# We are not using ensure_local_checks.yml here, because we need access to other
# variables in a programatic way, which the combination of task and template can
# not currently handle.
#
# Instead, we are defining a variable which contains the list of process names
# to check for. This list is contained in the dicts in process_checks_list. This
# is more simple than cobbling together hacks to accomplish the same outcome.
